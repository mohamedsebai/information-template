                        What is a Web Designer?
                        A web designer is someone who is both creative and technically inclined, and uses both these attributes to build or redesign websites. The web designer has the ability to understand what is needed to make a website functional and easy to use, but at the same time make it aesthetically appealing to the user.

They focus on the style and overall feel of the page, using software like Photoshop to customize the website’s visual elements. They also use code like HTML and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to create their designs.

                        <p class="card-text">A web designer's main job is to design web pages. There is a lot to consider in the design of websites which may not be immediately apparent when looking at a webpage for the first time.
                        The aesthetic aspect is an important one.

                      <p>HTML5 has been designed to deliver almost everything you'd want to do online without requiring additional software such as browser plugins. It does everything from animation to apps, music to movies, and can also be used to build incredibly complicated applications that run in your browser.
                      There's more. HTML5 isn't proprietary, so you don't need to pay royalties to use it. It's also cross-platform, which means it doesn't care whether you're using a tablet or a smartphone, a netbook, notebook or ultrabook or a Smart TV: if your browser supports HTML5, it should work flawlessly. Inevitably, it's a bit more complicated than that. More about that in a moment.
                      HTML5 is an evolving standard, so it's a bit misleading to talk about when it'll be finished.
                      What's important is that HTML's features - such as the aforementioned geolocation, web apps, video and graphics can be used now, provided your browser supports them.

                      <p>To help build highly interactive online pages, CSS3 is strongly recommended due to its importance in providing greater options in the design process. When marketing products and services, web design plays a vital part; a site should be created in a manner that will draw potential customers to explore and revisit a website more often. Many Texas web design firms are developing and enhancing websites through the use of CSS3 as this is a great form of web development. This article will help define CSS3 and will point out its advantages.
                      Since the introduction of CSS3, there is greater control of the presentation of content and various elements on a website; however it is not really responsible for overall design as it only specifies the structure and content presentation of certain web pages.

                      <p>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
                      JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.
                      son,It is really impossible to give a complete list of all the available Javascript frameworks and libraries. The Javascript world is just too large and too much new is happening.

In the document node is the DOM (Document Object Model), the document object model, which represents the contents of the page. You can manipulate it using javascript.
                      <br><br>DOM -> Document Object Model in JavaScript is the API to access the elements inside the document. It maps the entire Document into an hierarchy of parent and child tree.

                      <p>Bootstrap is an open-source Javascript framework developed by the team at Twitter. It is a combination of HTML,    CSS, and Javascript code designed to help build user interface components. Bootstrap was also programmed to        support both HTML5 and CSS3.
